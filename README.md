## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
> yarn dev 
# or
> npm run dev 

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
> yarn dev -- --open
# or
> npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy this app, you just need to push commits on branch main.
