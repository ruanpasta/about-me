      "resume": "I had always wanted to work with technology. When I was a child, I remember that my first contact with this universe was on a Tibia server that I created to play with my friends and it ended up working out vey well. In those days, I didn't think that this area was really for me. Many years later, the fate led me to meet a JAVA course, where I completed a small application with JAVA, MySQL, JS, HTML, and CSS as my final project, which sparked my interest in programming.\n\n Since then, I have specialized in frontend development, primarily using JS frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte. I also did some works with Ionic and Flutter.\n\n I love getting to know new technologies, testing concepts and seeing the things working. I have been gaining experience in DevOps, Backend and UI/UX areas. I intend to do more projects related to these areas, to reinforce my knowledge and learn new things."
